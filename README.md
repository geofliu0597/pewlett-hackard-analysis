# Module 7 Challenge - Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview

In this challenge, we are tackling the problem of creating tables that determine the number of retiring employees per title, as well as finding the amount of people that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
 - There are a lot of individuals that are eligibile for retiring
 - Most notably, there are 25916 Senior Engineers aone, and 24926 Senior Staff. 

 - There are 1550 individuals who are eligible for mentorship at the company. Although some of which are already titled "Senior"
 - There are a lot more staff that are eligible to retire than there are to mentor into those positions.

## Summary

My primary recommendations are that they change up the mentorship requirements to somehow begin replacing all the employees that are eligible to retire. A change in the parameters to increase the number of eligible mentorees.

Another consideration is to omit Senior Titles from the mentorship eligibility list and include more people who would benefit more from the mentorship to replace all the senior partners that are leaving.
